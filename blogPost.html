                        he present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf. Approximately, I repeat; for a very close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be prose to a modern ear.
                        The Heyne-Socin text and
                        glossary have been closely followed. 
                        Occasionally a deviation has been made, 
                        but always for what seemed good and sufficient reason.
                        The translator does not aim to be an editor. Once in a while, however, he has added a conjecture 
                        of his own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students of the poem.

                        This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike the translator 
                            begs sympathy and co-operation. The Anglo-Saxon scholar he hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original.
                        The student of English literature he aims to interest by giving him, in modern garb, the most ancient epic of our race.
                        This is a bold and venturesome undertaking; 
                        and yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow even a daring guide, 
                        if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of Hrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf,
                        and of the feelings that stirred the hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.

                        Beowulf is an Old English epic poem consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines.
                         It is one of the most important works of Old English literature. 
                         The date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars;
                          the only certain dating pertains to the manuscript, 
                        which was produced between 975 and 1025
